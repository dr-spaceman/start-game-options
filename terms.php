<h1>Terms of Use</h1>

<p>We are impoverished enthusiasts that happen to run this modest site devoted to that which is wondrous in the world of escapism: <i>videogames</i>. Since we don't have the time or resources to back with force some legalese mumbo-jumbo, we'll keep it simple for all users:</p>

<p>If you like something we say, give us credit. If we have something that you haven't seen before and want to use it, give us credit. In other words...</p>

<p><big>Use common sense. Don't be a dick.</big></p>

<p>Thanks for visiting!</p>
